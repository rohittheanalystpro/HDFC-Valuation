# HDFC-Valuation
I conducted a valuation of HDFC using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), but the high reinvestment rate made it difficult to apply effectively. As a result, I opted for relative valuation, which is better suited for such cases. Additionally, I performed a Camel Factor analysis to assess HDFC's financial health across key parameters. The combination of these methods provides a comprehensive view of HDFCâ€™s stability and valuation. Relative valuation offers a clearer picture for comparison within the industry.
